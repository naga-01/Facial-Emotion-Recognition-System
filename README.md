This Project captures 7 human emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). I have used fer2013 dataset which consists of 28,709 training examples and 3,589 testing images.

This Project was built using Convolution Neural Network(Deep Learning). I have built a model which consists of 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers with ReLu as Activation Function.

This system is integrated with Flask framework for better User experiance.
